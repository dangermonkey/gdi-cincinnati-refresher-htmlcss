# HTML/CSS Refresher Workshop

This is the curriculum for the Cincinnati HTML/CSS Refresher Workshop. It is a fast paced workshop, meant to get students back on track before the Intermediate class. It is a port of the official Girl Develop It Core HTML/CSS curriculum. It was developed through the initial contributions of Pamela Fox, Alexis Goldstein, Erin M. Kidwell, Izzy Johnston, Jen Myers and further modified over the years by John Back and Eric Boggs. 

The course is meant to be taught in one 2.5 hour course. Each of the slides are customizable according to the needs of a given class or audience.
